# Midterm Project, 3D Object Detection, Report

In order to conplete the midterm project the following files has been modified:
1) objdet_pcl.py
2) objdet_detect.py
3) objdet_eval.py

The code is used to visualize the point cloud and explore the environment. The result can be found in the following figures:

![](report_images/lidar3.JPG)
![](report_images/lidar4.JPG)
![](report_images/lidar5.JPG)

![](report_images/lidar7.JPG)
![](report_images/lidar8.JPG)
![](report_images/lidar9.JPG)

it is obvious that the different vehicles have different level of visibility and it depends to the enviromental features and conditions such as distance, any obsticle in front of the main vehicle, and etc. 
The bird-eye-view of the point cloud, its intensity and height images have been created as following figures:

 Based on the previous steps, the detected objects are shown in the following figures:
